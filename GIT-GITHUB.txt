5.DIFFERENT TYPES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM?
->>
1.Local Version Control Systems: It is one of the simplest forms and has a database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. RCS is one of the most common VCS tools. It keeps patch sets (differences between files) in a special format on disk. By adding up all the patches it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time. 

2.Centralized Version Control Systems: Centralized version control systems contain just one repository globally and every user need to commit for reflecting one’s changes in the repository. It is possible for others to see your changes by updating. 

3.Distributed Version Control Systems: Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository and working copy. Just committing your changes will not give others access to your changes. This is because commit will reflect those changes in your local repository and you need to push them in order to make them visible on the central repository. Similarly, When you update, you do not get others’ changes unless you have first pulled those changes into your repository. 


6.WHAT BENEFIT'S COME WITH USING GIT?
->>
1.Data replication and redundancy are both possible.
2.It is a service with high availability.

7.WHAT IS GIT REPOSITORY?
->>
The term "Git repository" describe the location where all git files are kept.

8.HOW CAN YOU INTIALIZE A REPOSITORY IN GIT?
->>
The git init command must be used to intialise an empty repository to a directory in Git . following this cammand ,
a hidden .git folder will become visible .
