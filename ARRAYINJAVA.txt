                                                                  _________________ARRAY IN JAVA____________________



1.What is the default value of Array for different data types?
->>
S.No.	Datatype			 Default Value
1	boolean	           		    false
2	int	            	 	      0
3	double	           	 	     0.0
4	String	           		     null
5	User-Defined Type		     null

2.Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
->>
No, you cannot use a negative integer as size, the size of an array represents the number of elements in it,
 â€“ve number of elements in an array makes no sense. if you pass the negative value to the Array compiler gives
you a error.

3.where does Array stored in JVM memory?
->>
Array is an object in java.so' Array is stored in the heap memory of JVM.

4.What are the disadvantages of Array?
->>
Fixed size: Arrays have a fixed size that is determined at the time of creation.
This means that if the size of the array needs to be increased, a new array must be created and the data must
be copied from the old array to the new array, which can be time-consuming and memory-intensive.

Memory allocation issues: Allocating a large array can be problematic, particularly in systems with limited memory.
If the size of the array is too large, the system may run out of memory, which can cause the program to crash.

5.What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? give an example?
->>
Properties of Anonymous Arrays:

1.We can create an array without a name. Such types of nameless arrays are called anonymous arrays.
2.The main purpose of an anonymous array is just for instant use (just for one-time usage).
3.An anonymous array is passed as an argument of a method..

Example-
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
          // anonymous array
          sum(new int[]{ 1, 2, 3 });
    }
   
    public static void sum(int[] a)
    {
        int total = 0;
 
        // using for-each loop
        for (int i : a)
            total = total + i;
         
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + total);
    }
}

6.What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java ?
->>
1.Using for loop.
2.Using for each loop.

7.What is the differnce between length and length() method give an Examples?
->>
length:
An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of the same type.
the length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e a number of elements 
stored in an array .
once arrays are intialized,its length cannot be changed , so the length variable can directly be used 
to get the length of an array. the length variable is used only for an array.
Example:
public class Test{
        public static void main(String args[]){
int array[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
System.out.println("Length of an array is :" +array.length);
 }
}

//output:length of an array is 7:

length()
The length() method is static method of string class.
The length() returns the legal of a string object i.e the number of characters stored in an object.
String class uses this method because the length of a string can be modified using the various operations on 
an object.
The string class internally uses a char[] array that it does not expose to the outside world.
Example:
public class Test{
          public static void main(String args[]){
String str="wellcome to PW";
System.out.println("length of string using length() method is:" + str.length());
}
}
//output: Length of string using length() method is 26
