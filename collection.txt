1.What is the collection framework in java ?
->
Collection Framework is a combination of classes and interface, which is used to store and manipulate the data in the form of objects.
it's provided various classes such as ArrayList,Vector stack and Hashset, etc. and interfaces such as List,Queue, Set,etc for this purpose.

2.What is difference between Arraylist and LinkedList?
->
		ArrayList													LinkedList

1.ArraList uses a dynamic array.										1.LinkedList uses a doubly LinkList.

2.ArrayList is not efficient for manipulation									2.LinkedList is efficient for manipulation.
because too much is required.

3.ArrayList is better to store and fetch data.									3.LinkedList is better to manipulate data.

4.ArrayList provides random access.										4.LinkedList does not provide random access.

5.ArrayList takes less memory overhead as									5.LinkedList takes more memory overhead, as it store the object
it store only object.												  as well as address of that object.


3.What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
->

					Iterator 									ListIterator

direction only.

2.The iterator can be used in List, Set and Queue.							2.ListIterator can be used in list only.

3.The Iterator can only perform a remove operation							3.ListIterator can perform? add? remove? and? set? operation while travering the

4. What is the difference between iterator and Enumeration?
->
 			Iterator 											Enumaration
1. The iterator can traverse lagacy and non-lagacy element.						1.Enumaration can traverse only lagacy elements.

2.The iterator is fail-fast.										2.Enumaration is not fails fast.

3.The iterator is slower than Enumaration.								3.Enumaration is faster than iterator.

4.The iterator can perform remove operation while 							4.The Enumaration can perform only traverse operations on the collection.
traversing the collection.


5.What is the difference between List and Set?
-> 
The List and Set both extend the co;;ection interface.However,Thereare some differences between between two which are Listed below.

i>the list can contain duplicate elements whereas Set includes unique items.
ii>The list is an ordered collection which maintains insertion order whereas Set is an unorderd collection which does not preserve insertion order.
iii>The List insertion contains a single lagacy class which is vector class whereas Set interface does not have any lagacy class.
iv>The list interface can allow a number of a null values whereas set interface only allows a single null value.

6.What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
->
Both HashSet and TreeSet are the implementation of Set interface in java. but they have some differences in term of their properties and usage.

i>Ordering: Hashset is an unorderd collection of elements,while treeset is a sorted Set of elements based on their natural order or a custom comparator.
ii>Duplication:Hashset Does not allow duplicate elements, while treeset does not allow duplicates as well.
iii>Implimention:Hashset is implement using a hashtable, while treeset is implemented using self balancing binary search tree(red-black tree).
iv>performance:HashSet has constant-time complexity O(1)for adding removing and testing the existance of an element.while treeset has logarithmic time complexity
O(log n) for these operations due to the self balancing property.
v>Memory usage:HashSet uses less memory than TreeSet because it only stores the elements,while TreeSet stores additional information for maintaing the order.
vi>Iteration:HashSet provides no garantees regarding the order of iteration, while treeset garantees the elements iterated in sorted order.
vii>Usage:HashSet is suitable when elements needs to be stored or accessed in specific order.

7.What is the difference between Array and ArrayList ?
->
i>Type:Arrays can store elements of premitive datatypes as wellas objects,while ArrayList can only stores the objects.
i>Size: the size of an Array is fixed once it is created,while the size of an ArrayList can be dynamically increases or decreases by adding removing elements.
i>Mutability:Arrays are mutable, meaning that you can modify the element in an array after it has been created.ArrayList is also mutable , but the only way to modify it is by adding,
removing and modifying the elements.
i>performance:Arrays have better performance than ArrayLists for certain operations,such as accessing elements by index, because they are implemented as a continuous block of memory.
ArrayList on the other hand , use dynamic memory allocation and are implemented as a dynamic array, which may result in more memory overhead and slower performance for certain operation.
i>Method:Array have a limited set of methods compared to ArrayList's.which provides more methods for mnupulating the collection,such as adding , removing and sorting elements.
i>Initialization:Arrays can be initialize with values at the time of creation, while the ArrayList requries the use of methods to add elements to the collection.
i>compatibility:Arrays are compatible with traditional for loop and can be easily pass to the other methods,while arraylist requires the use of a special for each loop and may require 
more code to be pass to other methods.

8.What is a Map in java?
->A Map is collection in java that stores data as key value pairs,where each key is unique.

9.What are the commonly used implementations of Map in java ?
->
The commonly used implementetions of Map in java are HashMap,TreeMap,LinkedHashMap,and ConcurrentHashMap.

10.What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
->
HashMap is an unordered collection that uses hashing to store the key value pairs, while tree map is a sorted collection that stores the key value pairs in sorted order 
based on the natural order of the key or custom comparator.

11.how do you check if a key exists in a Map in java?
->
we can check if a key exists in a map in java using a containsKey() method or the get() method. A containsKey method returns a boolean value 
indicating whether a map contains the specified key, while the get() method returns the value associated with the specified key,or null if the key is not present in the Map.
