_________________________________________________________Generics In Java --
Q.1What are generics in java?
->Generics in java are used to provide type safety and reduce code redundancy by allowing the use of generic types.It allows classes,methods and interfaces,
to be written generically, Without specifying the type of data being used.

Q.2What are the benefits of using generics in java ?
->The benefits of using generics in java are:
Type Safety 
Code reusability
Improved readability
Reduced code redundancy
improved performance

Q.3What is a generic class in java ?
->A Generic class in java is a class that can work with different types of data. It is defined using a type parameter
enclosed in angle brackets,which represent the type of data being used.

Q.4 What is a Type parameter in java generics?
->A type parameter in java generics is a placeholder for the type of data that is used by a generic class or method.
It is defined using single uppercase letter enclosed in angle brackets such as <T> or <E>

Q.5What is a Generics method in Java?
->A generic mehtod in Java is a method That can works with different type of data.it's define using a type parameter
enclosed in angle brackets, Which represents the type of data being used 

Q.6What is the Difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?
->ArrayList is non-generic class,While ArrayList<T> is generic class. ArrayList<T> provides type safety, as it can only store elements
of the specified type ,whereas ArrayList can store any type of elements.

Q.What is input and Output Stream in java ?
->A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read data from a source and 
The OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.

Q.What are the methods of OutputStream ?
->1.write():write the specified byte to the output stream.
2.write(byte[] array):Writes the bytes from specified array to the output stream.
3.flush():forces to write all data present in OutputStream to the destination.
4.close():closes the Output Stream.

Q.What is Serialization in Java ?
->Serialization is the process of converting and object into a stream of bytes to transfer it over a network or to store it 
in a file or database.In Java, serialization is done by implementing the Serializable interface.

Q.What is Serializable interface in Java?
->The Serializable interface in java is a marker interface that has no methods.It is used to mark classes that can be serialized, 
meaning their Object instances can be converted into a stream of bytes.

Q.Whata is Deserialization in Java?
->Deserialization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into an object instance.
This is done after an object has been serialize.

Q.How is Serialization achieved in Java?
->Serialization is achieved in Java by implementing the serializable interface.When an Object is Serialized,it's state is converted into a 
stream of bytes,which can then be transfered over a network or stored in a file or database.

Q.How is Deserialization achieved in Java?
->Deserialization is achieved in Java by reading a stream of bytes and using them to recreate the original object instance.
This is done by calling the readObject() method of an ObjectInputStream instance.

Q.How can you avoid certain member variables of class from getting Serialized?
->Mark member variables as static or transient and those member variables will no more be a part of Serialization.

Q.What classes are available in the Java IO File classes API?
->The following classes available in Java IO API and are important to work with files in Java.

File 
RandomAccessFile 
FileInputStream 
FileReader
FileOutputStream
FlieWriter
